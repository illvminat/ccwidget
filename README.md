# ccwidget — Usage Widget for Claude Code

[![Build](https://github.com/illvminat/ccwidget/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/illvminat/ccwidget/actions/workflows/build.yml)


A macOS desktop widget showing how much of your Claude subscription you have
spent, how full the context window is, and when the weekly quota runs out.

> **Works with the terminal version of Claude Code only.**
> The widget is fed by the Claude Code status line, which exists solely in the
> CLI. If you use Claude only through the desktop app or the web, the status
> line never runs, nothing is ever written, and the widget stays empty
> forever — not "outdated", but blank. There is no workaround today. Removing
> this limitation is the top open question in [SPEC.md](SPEC.md#14-открытые-вопросы).

Everything else on this page assumes `claude` runs in your terminal.

Rendered by the same code the widget runs, from made-up data: one command,
`./Scripts/readme-screenshots.sh`. The numbers are a fixture rather than
somebody's account — they used to be live, which put a real session cost into a
public README and photographed the estimate saying *Not enough data yet*,
because the shots happened to be taken just after a weekly reset.

---

## What it shows

Three rows, all in the same direction: **how much has been consumed.** More is
always worse. The bar always matches the number next to it.

| Row | What it measures | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `5-hour used` | the rolling five-hour limit | your account |
| `Week used` | the seven-day limit | your account |
| `Context used` | how full the current context window is | one Claude Code session |

**`Context used` is not a subscription limit.** This is the row people
misread. The first two are quotas Anthropic enforces: hit 100% and Claude
stops answering until the window resets. The third is the size of the
conversation currently loaded into the model — it resets when you run
`/clear`, costs you nothing, and blocks nothing. It is here because past
roughly 70% the model starts losing details from the beginning of the
conversation, which is worth seeing before it happens. That is why its colour
turns red at 70% while the limits stay yellow until 81%.

Scope matters too. The two limits belong to your account and are identical no
matter which project you are working in. Context, cost and cache ratio belong
to a single Claude Code session — the one that redrew its status line last.
With several sessions open, those three values flicker between them, which is
why the widget labels them: the project name sits next to the context row, and
the footer says `this session`.

The large size adds an estimate of when the weekly quota runs out:
least-squares regression over the current week's history, weighted towards
recent usage. It is built to refuse rather than to guess, and it has three
answers instead of two:

- **A date** — but only when there are at least ten points spanning at least
  two hours, the line fits them (R² ≥ 0.7), and the date lands within ten
  times the span the points cover. Extrapolating a day of usage across a week
  is arithmetic, not knowledge.
- **A rate with no date** — "~0.7 %/h". Right after the weekly reset the
  reset is nearly seven days out and no honest date can be named for about
  seventeen hours, but the pace is already measurable, and silence for
  seventeen hours reads as broken.
- **Nothing** — too few points, too short a span, or a line that does not
  describe the data. A wrong estimate is worse than none.

> **If you use Claude Code on more than one Mac, the estimate is low.** The
> limits belong to your account and arrive correct on every machine — Claude
> Code sends them. The history behind the estimate does not: each machine keeps
> its own, and sees only its own work. So the rate is measured from a fraction
> of what you are actually spending, and the date it names is later than the
> truth.
>
> Nothing detects this, and nothing here corrects for it. The three obvious
> fixes are all worse than the warning: pooling the histories would mean data
> leaving your machine, which this project does not do; showing the estimate
> only on one machine needs a signal the data does not carry; and hiding it
> would take the feature away from everybody to protect a few. If you work from
> two Macs, read the estimate as a floor rather than a forecast.

## Trusting the numbers

The status line format is undocumented, so the numbers deserve verification.
There is exactly one independent source: the **Usage panel in the Claude app.**

Both show consumption, so the check is one glance with no arithmetic:

| Widget row | Usage panel | Should match |
|---|---|---|
| `5-hour used` | **Current session** | yes, digit for digit |
| `Week used` | **All models** | yes, digit for digit |
| `Context used` | — | not shown there; it is not a subscription limit |
| — | **Fable** | not shown here; the status line has no per-model breakdown |

Two names are confusing and worth stating plainly. Anthropic's **"Current
session"** means the five-hour account window, not your conversation — which
is exactly why this widget says `5-hour` instead of `Session`. And **"All
models"** is the weekly window.

A one-percent difference is fine: the exporter rounds fractional values. More
than that is a bug — please [open an issue](../../issues).

### The window and the widget can hold different snapshots

While an agent is working, the window may show figures the widget has not
caught up with yet. That is expected and it is not a bug.

The window reads the file the moment it changes; the widget is redrawn only
when macOS is asked to reload it, and that is rationed so the reload budget
lasts. So the widget can be holding a snapshot up to a minute old.

What does **not** differ any more is what they say about the snapshot they are
holding. Both print the time it was taken — *updated at 11:50* — rather than
how long ago that was, and both hand the countdown to a reset straight to the
system rather than computing it. Neither is doing arithmetic the other could
do differently.

The percentages are whole numbers and move slowly, so in practice they agree.
In the minute where one of them crosses a whole point they can differ, for the
reason above and no longer. The other places it shows are the exact token count
on the large tile and the *Snapshot* row under Details in the window.

Worth an issue if the widget stays behind for more than a minute while Claude
Code is running.

## Languages

The interface is in English, German, Spanish, Japanese, Russian and Simplified
Chinese, and follows your system language.

> **Four of those six have never been read by a native speaker.** German,
> Spanish, Japanese and Simplified Chinese are one developer's best effort with
> a dictionary and a careful ear. English and Russian are first-language work.
>
> The row captions were already rewritten once, after reading them aloud caught
> translations that were word-for-word correct and that nobody says — German
> `Woche genutzt` and Spanish `Semana usada` both meant "a week that was used".
> There are almost certainly more of those.
>
> **If you read one of the four, corrections are the single most welcome
> contribution to this project right now.** One line in an issue is enough — no
> pull request needed, no need to know Swift, and the string catalogs are plain
> JSON if you would rather edit them directly. See
> [`Docs/localization-review.md`](Docs/localization-review.md) for the exact
> strings and what each one is for.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 or later (the oldest version the checks run on)
- Claude Code, terminal version, used at least once
- A Claude subscription that reports rate limits

**What "macOS 14 or later" is worth.** CI builds the app and runs the checks
on macOS 14 and on macOS 26, so the code compiles and its logic runs on both.
That is the whole of it. The widget itself — WidgetKit, the timeline, the
three sizes on a real desktop — has only ever been run by hand, on macOS 26.
There is no automated way to put a widget on a desktop, and the view code has
no test coverage at all. If you are on 14 or 15 and something looks wrong,
that is worth an issue: you would be the first to look.

## Installing

```sh
brew install --cask illvminat/tap/ccwidget
```

Or download **[the disk image](../../releases/latest)** and drag the app to
Applications. Either way it is signed with a Developer ID and notarized by
Apple, so it opens without argument — including on a Mac that has never seen
this source and including offline, because the notarization ticket is stapled to
both the disk image and the app inside it.

Verify what you downloaded, if you like:

```sh
spctl -a -vvv -t exec /Applications/CCWidget.app
# accepted, source=Notarized Developer ID
```

Uninstalling through Homebrew undoes the configuration as well as removing the
app — `brew uninstall --cask ccwidget` runs the uninstaller from inside the
bundle, so your `statusLine` does not end up running a file that is no longer
there. Add `--zap` to delete the collected history too.

One thing only the app can undo: if you turned background updates on, use
**Remove…** in the app rather than Homebrew, or do it before uninstalling. The
registration belongs to `SMAppService`, and neither a shell script nor Homebrew's
own login-item removal can reach it — what is left is an entry in System Settings
that cannot start anything, because the app it points at is gone.

**Upgrading through Homebrew repairs the status-line setup by itself** (from
0.3.5; on 0.3.4 and earlier you have to press Set up automatically again after
every upgrade). The mechanics have not changed — `brew upgrade` still runs the
*installed* version's uninstaller before replacing the app, and that still
removes the exporter and the `statusLine` key; Homebrew sorts the `uninstall`
stanza ahead of the app on purpose, and the only directive it skips during an
upgrade is `signal` — see `UPGRADE_REINSTALL_SKIP_DIRECTIVES` in its own
`Library/Homebrew/cask/artifact/uninstall.rb`. What changed is the aftermath:
the cask now runs the freshly installed app with `--reinstall-exporter`, which
puts back exactly what the uninstaller removed and nothing else. It refuses in
two cases, on purpose: when you removed the widget through **Remove…** — the
app leaves a marker recording that choice, and an upgrade must not overrule it
— and when the exporter on disk is not the one the app wrote, because a
hand-modified file is something to look at, not something to overwrite quietly.

If the setup screen greets you anyway, the repair had nothing to restore or
refused for one of those reasons; when it finds data from an earlier setup it
says the configuration was removed rather than never made, instead of greeting
you as a new arrival. Moving the removal to Homebrew's `zap` stanza was
considered and rejected — it would make a plain `brew uninstall` leave the
exporter running in your prompt for good, which is a worse thing to be quiet
about than a button press.

Then, in this order:

1. **Add the widget to your desktop first** — right-click the desktop, choose
   *Edit Widgets*, find *Usage Widget for Claude Code*. This step cannot be
   skipped: the exchange directory is created by the system when the widget
   extension first runs, and the app deliberately refuses to create it itself.
2. Open the app and press **Set up automatically.** It writes the exporter to
   `~/.claude/ccwidget-export.py` and adds one `statusLine` key to
   `~/.claude/settings.json`. A timestamped copy of your settings is saved
   first. Normally only that one key changes and your indentation and key order
   survive; if the file cannot be patched in place — malformed JSON, comments —
   it is rebuilt instead, and the app tells you so rather than hiding it.
3. Send any message in Claude Code. The first numbers appear within seconds.

**If you already have a status line, it keeps working.** Setup reads whatever
`statusLine.command` was there and the exporter calls it, hands it the same
input Claude Code sent, and prints its output — so `ccstatusline` or a script
of your own goes on rendering your prompt while the widget gets its data. The
command it chains is shown to you before setup, and removal puts it back as
your `statusLine`. See *Sharing the status line* below.

Prefer not to let an app edit your config? The setup screen has **Show manual
instructions** with the exact lines to paste.

### Building it yourself instead

Needs **Xcode 16 or later** and **XcodeGen**, which generates the Xcode project
from `project.yml`.

```sh
brew install xcodegen
git clone https://github.com/illvminat/ccwidget.git
cd ccwidget
./Scripts/reinstall.sh
```

`reinstall.sh` is a **development script, not an installer.** It generates the
project, removes `/Applications/CCWidget.app` if present, copies a fresh build
over it, restarts `chronod` — the system daemon behind every widget on your Mac
— and then checks that the extension survived a render and that the tile drew
something. The restart is unavoidable (see Development below) and harmless: the
system brings it straight back and all widgets redraw.

Two things about a build you made yourself rather than downloaded:

- **With Xcode older than 26 it has no icon.** The icon is an Icon Composer
  `.icon` file, which only Xcode 26 compiles, and Xcode 26 itself needs macOS
  15.6 or later. Everything else works; the app shows a generic placeholder in
  the Dock and the widget gallery. Measured on a CI runner, not guessed.
- **A locally built app is ad-hoc signed** unless the machine has a Developer
  ID certificate, in which case `Scripts/reinstall.sh` re-signs the build with
  it — so that permissions macOS grants the app (it asks once for access to
  the widget's data) stay granted across rebuilds. Ad-hoc is fine on the
  machine that built it and refused everywhere else. If you pass such a copy to somebody,
  macOS will tell them Apple could not verify it, and offer *Move to Trash* or
  *Done* — there is no "Open Anyway" in that dialog. That button lives in
  **System Settings › Privacy & Security**, below the message about the blocked
  app, and only after they have tried to open it once. Checked by quarantining
  a copy the way a download would be. Hand out the notarized release instead.

## When the numbers stop moving

**First, one dialog to rule out.** If macOS has shown *"CCWidget.app" was not
opened — Apple could not verify it is free of malware*, with only *Move to
Trash* and *Done*, the widget is blocked, not broken. It happens when the
system runs the widget out of a freshly installed copy before you have opened
the app yourself — typically at the first login after an upgrade that ran
while the app was open. Press *Done*, then open **System Settings › Privacy &
Security**, scroll to the note about CCWidget and press **Open Anyway**; the
widget comes back within a minute. The Homebrew cask now quits the app on
upgrade and opens the new copy so that you approve it right away, in the
ordinary "downloaded from the internet — Open?" dialog, and this one does not
appear. Reproduced and closed on 18 August 2026; details in `SPEC.md`,
section 2.2.

Claude Code is running, you are working, and the widget has not changed in a
while. On screen that looks exactly like Claude Code not running at all — the
numbers simply age. These are different problems and there is one command that
tells them apart.

Build `ccwidget-dump` with the command under [Development](#development) — one
copy of it, so it cannot drift from the one CI runs — and then:

```sh
./.build/ccwidget-dump
```

**If it starts with `!! The exporter is writing nothing`**, the status line is
running and choosing not to write:

```
!! The exporter is writing nothing.
   since:   3 Aug 2026 at 20:48:30
   for:     8 min
   reason:  the status line sent no rate_limits
```

That happens when Claude Code sends a redraw with no rate limits in it. Every
session begins with one such redraw, and the notice clears itself the moment
you send your first message — so seeing it for a second or two after starting
Claude Code is normal.

A notice that outlives that, minutes into a working session, is something we
have never seen and would like to: please [open an issue](../../issues) with
the *since* and *for* lines. It means the status line has stopped sending
limits, and the numbers you are looking at are as old as the notice says.

**If there is no such line and the snapshot is simply old**, nothing is writing
at all. The usual causes, in the order worth checking:

- Claude Code is the desktop app rather than the terminal one — the status line
  only runs in the terminal, and this widget has no other source.
- The `statusLine` key in `~/.claude/settings.json` no longer points at
  `~/.claude/ccwidget-export.py`. The app's window says **Setup needed** when
  that is the case.
- **Your other status line went blank instead** — that is a different problem
  with the same look. `ccwidget-dump` prints a notice saying since when and
  why: a chained command that is missing, failing or too slow. The widget's own
  numbers are unaffected, because they are written before it runs.
- The exporter file was deleted or replaced. The window's **Details** says
  *modified since installation* or *not installed*.

**If the numbers are current but the widget is showing older ones**, that is
expected up to a minute — the widget is redrawn at most once a minute so the
reload budget lasts. See *The window and the widget can hold different snapshots*
above.

## Removing it

Either way undoes the same things, with one difference named below: the script
keeps the exporter file when something in `settings.json` still refers to it,
and the app deletes it either way.

In the app: **Remove…**, then choose whether to keep the collected history.

Or without the app:

```sh
./Scripts/uninstall.sh            # keep history
./Scripts/uninstall.sh --purge    # remove history, container and the app
./Scripts/uninstall.sh --dry-run  # show what would happen, change nothing
```

Removal deletes the `statusLine` key rather than restoring your old
`settings.json` wholesale — you may have changed other keys since installing,
and rolling the file back would take those edits away from you. A backup is
still written first.

It only deletes that key if it is ours — if `statusLine.command` is exactly the
exporter this installation wrote, written as an absolute path or with `~` or
`$HOME`, which name the same file. A status line of your own that calls the
exporter and adds to its output is left where it is, and so is the exporter
itself, since something is still calling it. The same goes for a hook that
refers to it. If `settings.json` cannot be parsed, nothing is removed at all
and you are told what to remove by hand.

The app bundle and the extension's container are not removed unless you pass
`--purge`, and the widget itself has to be dragged off the desktop by hand.

## How it works

```
Claude Code ──status line JSON──▶ ccwidget-export.py ──▶ snapshot.json
                                                        history.jsonl
                                                             │
                                              widget extension container
                                                             │
                                                     WidgetKit timeline
```

The exporter runs on every status line redraw, writes atomically, and always
exits 0 — a broken exporter must never break your prompt.

### Sharing the status line

The exporter prints nothing of its own, so it used to leave your status line
blank. It does not any more: whatever `statusLine.command` was there when you
ran setup is called by the exporter, given the same input Claude Code sent, and
its output is printed unchanged. `ccstatusline`, a shell script, an inline `jq`
pipeline — they go on rendering your prompt.

Four things worth knowing about how that is done:

- **Your data is written first, their command second.** Writing the snapshot
  takes about twenty milliseconds and cannot hang; someone else's program can.
  This way a broken status line does not also stop the widget getting data —
  one problem stays one problem. Your prompt is twenty milliseconds late, which
  nobody can see.
- **Three seconds and then it is abandoned.** The status line redraws dozens of
  times a minute, so a command that hangs would hang every one of them.
- **A failure is recorded rather than swallowed.** If the chained command is
  missing, fails or times out, the exporter notes when and why in the container
  and `./.build/ccwidget-dump` prints it. It cannot tell you on stdout —
  anything it prints lands in your prompt — and a prompt that has gone blank
  will be blamed on this widget, so silence is the one thing it must not do.
- **Removal puts your command back** as your `statusLine`, with the rest of the
  key — `padding`, `refreshInterval` — as you had it. Setup only ever changes
  `command`.

The command being chained is shown to you on the setup screen before you press
anything.

**How fast the widget updates depends on whether anything of ours is running.**
The watcher inside the app notices a new snapshot and asks WidgetKit to redraw —
rationed to once a minute, so the reload budget lasts. With nothing running,
WidgetKit comes back on its own roughly every half hour. The numbers are never
wrong, only older than they could be, and the widget always says how old they
are.

**Background updates** — the switch under *Details* in the window — registers the
app as a login item so that watcher runs whether or not you have a window open.
It is off until you turn it on: a login item runs on every session without being
asked, which is yours to grant rather than ours to assume. Turning it on may send
you to System Settings to confirm, and the window says so when it does.

There is no separate helper doing this, and that is not for want of trying: a
small executable inside the app bundle, registered as a launch agent, is refused
by WidgetKit — `ChronoCoreErrorDomain` 27 — and a reload from it changes nothing.
Measured, with a control. Only the app can reload its own widget, so background
freshness is the app running in the background.

**Everything happens on your machine.** There is no network code in this
project: nothing is uploaded, no telemetry is collected, and no account is
needed beyond the one Claude Code already uses. The widget never talks to
Claude at all — it reads a file that Claude Code itself hands to a status
line command you configured, and it holds no credentials of any kind. For a
tool whose whole job is watching how much of your quota is left, that is
worth knowing before you install it.

Data is exchanged through the widget extension's own sandbox container rather
than an App Group. App Groups do not work for widget extensions under ad-hoc
signing, and requiring a paid Apple Developer membership from everyone who
builds from source was not acceptable. The trade-offs are written up in
[SPEC.md](SPEC.md), section 2.2.

## Development

The console tools are not built by `reinstall.sh` — build them when you need
them:

```sh
# print the parsed snapshot and its parse diagnostics
swiftc -swift-version 6 -target arm64-apple-macos14.0 \
    Shared/Snapshot.swift Shared/SnapshotStore.swift Shared/Formatters.swift \
    Shared/Diagnostics.swift Shared/AgeClock.swift \
    Tools/ccwidget-dump/main.swift -o .build/ccwidget-dump

# replay a history.jsonl through the estimate: what the widget would have
# shown, for how long, and at every change of state
swiftc -swift-version 6 -target arm64-apple-macos14.0 \
    Shared/Snapshot.swift Shared/SnapshotStore.swift Shared/Formatters.swift \
    Shared/Diagnostics.swift Shared/AgeClock.swift \
    Shared/HistoryStore.swift Shared/Forecast.swift \
    Tools/ccwidget-replay/main.swift -o .build/ccwidget-replay

# re-shoot the screenshots, or render any view without putting a widget on a
# desktop. Needs the views as well as the shared code, which is why the list
# is longer.
swiftc -swift-version 6 -target arm64-apple-macos14.0 \
    Shared/*.swift \
    Widget/Provider.swift Widget/Components.swift Widget/ForecastChart.swift \
    Widget/SmallView.swift Widget/MediumView.swift Widget/LargeView.swift \
    Tools/ccwidget-screenshots/main.swift -o .build/ccwidget-screenshots
```

**Render in the language you are changing.** The tool takes the locale from the
arguments, and a layout that fits in English can fail in Russian or German:

```sh
./.build/ccwidget-screenshots /tmp/shots -AppleLocale ru_RU -AppleLanguages "(ru)"
```

The README's own six come from `./Scripts/readme-screenshots.sh`, which writes a
fixture and shoots against it. The fixture is generated at shoot time rather
than committed, and that is not a preference: a row's countdown is a **dynamic
date**, drawn by the system from the real clock and not from the moment the
entry carries, so fixed timestamps render "2 yrs, 9 mths". Measured — the same
trap `RowCompositionTests` documents at the top of its file.

CI builds the first two of these on every push. The third is not built there —
so unlike the others, it can rot unnoticed — and the flags differ: CI adds
`-strict-concurrency=complete`, which these lines omit. Nothing compares the two,
so treat this block as a copy that can drift rather than as the same commands.

If the icon stays a grey placeholder after the first install, that is macOS's
icon cache rather than the build. It survives reinstalling, `lsregister` and a
`chronod` restart; what clears it is:

```sh
sudo rm -rf /Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store
sudo find /private/var/folders -name com.apple.dock.iconcache -delete
killall Dock
```

Before reaching for that, check the bundle actually carries the icon — the two
products are compiled by `actool`, not copied, and a build says nothing either
way. The second command renders the standalone copy to a PNG you can open:

```sh
ls /Applications/CCWidget.app/Contents/Resources/Assets.car \
   /Applications/CCWidget.app/Contents/Resources/CCWidget.icns
sips -s format png /Applications/CCWidget.app/Contents/Resources/CCWidget.icns \
     --out /tmp/ccwidget-icon.png && open /tmp/ccwidget-icon.png
```

If those show the ring and the surfaces still show a square, it is the cache.

Watching what the widget actually does:

```sh
log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "dev.illvminat.ccwidget"' --level info
```

`killall chronod` at the end of the install script is not optional: the widget
daemon survives bundle replacement and otherwise keeps running your previous
build, which looks exactly like your changes not applying.

[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) has the rest. [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) is the
design document and is kept current — it records the failures too, which is
usually where the reasoning lives. It is written in Russian; translating it is
on the list.
